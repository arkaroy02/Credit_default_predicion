From the above models we can conclude that Boosting algorithm comes out to be the best model.
The problem of data imbalance is handled by Smotenc,Under and Oversampling techniques.
Our primary metric here is F1 score, which is highest for Lightgbm with oversampling.
As there doesn't seems to be a problem of overfitting I have not done PCA or any dimension reduction.
